Day 27, 
These are my notes from chapter 14

Profile configuration in cargo.toml:
[profile.dev]
key = value

[profile.release]
key = value
Profile options: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html

/// marks documentation comments and supports markdown syntax. cargo doc --open will open it in HTML

Commonly used sections:
#Example
#Panics
#Errors
#Safety

//! Documentation comment about the crate in general

Reexporting:
pub use self::module::function --> This way a function can be used publically without having to know the exact module structure

Mandatory information for packages:
[package]
name = ""
description = ""
license = ""

Deleting from crates.io is not possible, but it is possible to deprecate versions making sure no future crates can depend on it:
cargo yank --ver0.1.0
